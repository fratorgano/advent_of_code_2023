# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎄

I ended up not finishing last year's challenge and I probably won't finish this one either but here I am again!
The setup is basically the exact same as last year since it worked well enough, you can go read more [here](https://github.com/fratorgano/advent_of_code_2022#-new-this-year-)

I'm gonna stick to Rust as far as I can, I haven't used since last year so it might take a bit to get back up to speed

Bonus: since I'm following a game dev course I might do some days on C# and do a visualization using Unity! 🎮

🏆 Goal: do as much as I can! 🏆

## ❄️ How to use ❄️
`cargo run -p day**` - Runs a specific day

`cargo run -p day** --release` - Runs a specific day with compiler optimizations

`cargo test -p day**` - Tests a specific day

`cargo test` - Tests all

## 🥛 Results 🍪
